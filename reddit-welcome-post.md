# Welcome to r/TWRPInfoHelper! 🎉

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to launch this community for **TWRP Device Info Collector** - a free, open-source Android app that makes building custom TWRP recovery WAY easier!

---

## 🤔 What is TWRP Device Info Collector?

If you've ever tried to build TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) for your device using the [Hovatek Online TWRP Builder](https://www.hovatek.com/twrpbuilder/), you know how tedious it is to manually gather all your device specifications. 

This app **automates everything** - just tap a button and get ALL the info you need in one clean text file!

---

## ✨ What Does It Do?

The app automatically collects:

📱 **Device Info**: Codename, brand, model, manufacturer  
🤖 **Android Details**: Version, API level, build fingerprint  
📐 **Screen Specs**: Resolution, density (critical for TWRP!)  
⚙️ **CPU Architecture**: ABI, platform details  
🔧 **Kernel Version**: Full kernel information  
🔐 **Security Status**: Root access, SELinux, bootloader lock status  
💾 **Storage Paths**: System, data, cache partitions  
📊 **Memory Info**: RAM and storage details  

...and much more!

Then it saves everything to a clean text file in your Downloads folder: `twrp-builder-{your-device}.txt`
